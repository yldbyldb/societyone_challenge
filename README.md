# SocietyOne Coding Challenge 

>This code is for the SocietyOne coding challenge. All of the data is mock.

### Features

We are collecting customer data that apply for personal loans, so that we can better understand our user demographic. Imagine we have data from different customers combined into a single JSON array, where an individual sensor is identified by an ID. 

### Requirements

1. Create an application that takes a JSON array of contacts as input and outputs the average, median and mode age for these contact. 
2. The output should be returned in json format and rounded to 2 decimal places, if required. 

### Implementation guidelines

- We primarily use Go and Nodejs at SocietyOne. However, we believe all developers can be language agnostic. You can choose to develop in another language you fell more comfortable with.
- We expect you to push your production quality code to a github repository that we can review. This code should be able to run, maintainable and scalable.
- You should:
  - implement a runnable solution that meets the requirements
  - implement the mean, mode and average yourself (don’t use a library)
  - provide instructions on how to run your application
  - provide instructions on how to test your application
  - document any assumptions you made
  - document important design decisions and trade-offs
